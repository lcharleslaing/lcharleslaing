## Bio

I'm a self-taught programmer with a passion for creating marketable web applications. Over the past five years, I've honed my skills in Python, Sveltekit, and JavaScript. My expertise lies in web design and app development, and I'm constantly looking for new and innovative ways to create useful tools that solve real-world problems. I'm excited to collaborate with other developers and turn my ideas into reality.
